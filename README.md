## 1. General Description

__modelica-json__ is a translator that parses the Modelica language to JSON. Two translation modes have been implemented :
The first mode aims to parse Modelica packages and takes into input a directory of .mo files. The other mode aims to parse CDL files and takes a single .mo file compliant with the CDL language as input. For more information on the CDL Language, please refer to the [OpenBuildingControl ](http://obc.lbl.gov/specification/cdl.html) project website.

See the directory `test/FromModelica` from __modelica-json__ for simple examples from Modelica and CDL to detailed and simplified JSON.

## 2. Installation and help

### Linux

First, set the MODELICAPATH environment variable by adding the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:
```
export MODELICAPATH=${MODELICAPATH}:/usr/local/Modelica/Library/
```

The parser requires Java and node. The java dependency can be installed using:
```
sudo apt-get install default-jdk default-jre
```
The node version should be >= 18 and you can use [Node Version Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) to set it up. Following is using 0.39.7 version:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 18
```

To install dependencies of the parser, run
```
make install
```
To compile the Java files, run
```
make compile
```
To run the test cases, run
```
npm test
```
To get more help, run
```
node app.js -h
```
To clean the current installation, run
```
make clean-installation
```

### Windows

- First, make sure that both the `modelica-json` directory and the `Modelica Buildings Library` directory are in the folders that do not require administrator access.
  By saving the directories in driver other than `C:\` would typical avoid the administrator access issue.

- Then, create the `MODELICAPATH` environment variable and set the value as the path of Modelica Buildings Library, like `E:\modelica-buildings` or `E:\modelica-buildings-master`.

- Install [Java SE Development Kit (64-bit version)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html), [Java Runtime Environment (64-bit version)](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- Add `path\to\your\nodejs` to the `Path` environment.

- In batch file `InstallOnWindows.bat`, update `JAVA_HOME` path in line `set JAVA_HOME=path\to\your\jdk`.

- Finally, to install dependencies and compile the Java files, run `InstallOnWindows.bat`.

To test the installation, from the `\modelica-json` directory, run the parser on Command Prompt:
```
node app.js -f test\FromModelica\Enable.mo
```

Now the `\modelica-json` directory should have a new folder `json` and in the folder, there should be a file in the path `test\FromModelica\Enable.json`.

## 3. How to use the parser

The parser can be run with the app.js file as follows:
```
node app.js -f <path of the file to parse>
```

#### Arguments :

##### --file / -f
The only required input is the path of the file or package to be parsed.

##### --output / -o

This parser takes a .mo file in input and has three possible outputs, that can be specified with the argument -o :

- **raw-json** : detailed transcription of a Modelica file in JSON
- **json**: simplified JSON format, easier to read an interpret
- **semantic**: generate semantic model from semantic information included within `annotation` in the Modelica file
- **cxf**: generate CXF representation in `.jsonld` of a CDL sequence complying with ASHRAE S231P
- **doc**: create the documentation of the sequence of operation in an HTML document
- **doc+**: create the documentation of the sequence of operation and the list of all variables in an HTML document

##### --mode / -m

We offer two different modes of translation that can be chosen with the argument -m :

- **modelica** : Parses a Modelica package (must be a directory)
- **cdl** (default) : Parses a CDL file.

##### --log / -l

Logging level. The choices are `error`, `warn`, `info` (default), `verbose`, `debug`.

##### --directory / -d

Specify the output directory. The default option is the current directory.

##### --prettyPrint / -p

If `-p` flag is specified, the JSON output conforms to prettyprint. The default option is `false`.

##### --elementary

If `--elementary` flag is specified, the CXF (jsonld) files for the elementary blocks are also generated. Else, they are ignored. The default option is `false`.
`-o`/`--output` should be `cxf`.

##### --cxfCore

If `--cxfCore` flag is specified, generate the  CXF-core.jsonld files for all the elementary blocks. The default option is `false`.
`-o`/`--output` should be `cxf`, `-f`/`--file` should be `path/to/CDL` and `--elementary` flag must be used.

## 4. JSON Schemas

The JSON representation of Modelica and CXF models must be compliant with the corresponding JSON Schema. This is applicable for the JSON and CXF output respectively.

JSON Schemas describe the data format and file structure to ensure the quality of the JSON files.

Two schemas are available (links to the raw files) :
- [schema-cxf.json](schema-cxf.json) validates the JSON files parsed from CDL classes to form CXF representations
- [schema-modelica.json](schema-modelica.json) validates the JSON files parsed from Modelica models

Graphical viewers are available (please use right click + open in a new tab or refresh the page if necessary - this is not optimized for Firefox) :
- [CXF Schema viewer](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-json/blob/issue214_cxf/cxf-viz.html)
- [Modelica Schema viewer](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-json/blob/master/modelica-viz.html)

## 5. CXF-Core.jsonld

[CXF-Core.jsonld](CXF-Core.jsonld) contains the CXF representation of all CDL elementary blocks, classes and relationships.

To generate the `CXF-Core.jsonld`, use:

```
node app.js -f <path/to/modelica-buildings>/Buildings/Controls/OBC/CDL -o cxf --elementary --cxfCore
```

The `CXF-Core.jsonld` file will be generated in `cxf` folder.

When parsing a file using `app.js`, the schema is chosen according to the mode.

To validate an existing JSON file against the schema, run

```
node validation.js -f <path to the json file>
```
The default schema is CDL. To chose the Modelica schema, run:

```
node validation.js -f <path to the json file> -m modelica
```
